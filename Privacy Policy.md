📄 Privacy Policy

Last updated: 17/11/2025

This Privacy Policy explains how the Discord bot (“the Bot”) collects and uses data.

1. Data the Bot Collects

The Bot only collects the minimum data required for functionality, such as:
- User IDs and message content necessary for command execution
- Server IDs and configuration settings
- Temporary content for AI processing (if applicable)

The Bot does NOT store:
- Direct messages
- Sensitive personal information
- Server chat history

All processing is performed in real time unless otherwise stated.

2. AI Processing

If the Bot uses third-party AI APIs (e.g., OpenAI, xAI, etc.):
- Message excerpts, instructions, or images explicitly submitted to the Bot may be transmitted to the AI provider to generate responses.
- No training, fine-tuning, or long-term user profiling is performed by the Bot.

Review the AI provider’s privacy policy for how they handle data.

3. Data Storage

The Bot may store lightweight configuration data (e.g., settings, preferences, usage limits).
No personal data or message logs are permanently stored.
Cached information is deleted automatically when no longer needed.

4. Data Sharing

The Bot does not sell or share data with third parties.
Data is only shared with external AI providers strictly for processing user requests.

5. Security

Reasonable measures are taken to protect stored configuration data.
However, no system is fully secure, and server owners should limit access to Bot commands appropriately.

6. Your Rights

You may request:
- Removal of stored server configuration data
- Resetting or deletion of settings
- Server owners can remove the Bot at any time to stop all further data processing.
